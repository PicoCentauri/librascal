    """
    Farthest Point Sampling [1] routine using librascal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_matrix : numpy.ndarray[float64[n, m], flags.c_contiguous]
        Feature matrix with n samples and m features.
    n_select : int
        Number of sample to select
    starting_index : int, optional
        Index of the first sample to select (the default is None,
                           which corresponds to starting_index == 0)
    restart : dictionary, optional (only valid for method="simple")
        the return value of a previous call to FPS. the selection
        will continue where it has been left off. the dictionary
        should contain at least "fps_indices"; if "fps_minmax_d2" and
        "fps_hausdorff_d2" are present, they will be used to restart,
        otherwise they'll be recomputed

    method : str, optional
        Select which kind of FPS selection to perform:
        + 'simple' is the basic fps selection [1].
        + 'voronoi' uses voronoi polyhedra to avoid some
                    distance computations.

    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary containing the following quantities
    "fps_indices" : numpy.ndarray[int[n_select]]
        Selected indices refering to the feature_matrix order.
    "fps_minmax_d2": numpy.ndarray[float64[n_select]]
        MIN-MAX distance^2 at each step in the selection
    "fps_hausforff_d2": numpy.ndarray[float64[n]]
        array of Hausdorff distances between the n points and the
        n_select FPS points
    In addition, when method="voronoi", the following arrays are returned
    "fps_voronoi_indices": numpy.ndarray[int[n]]
        the indices that assign each of the n inputs to the closest FPS point
    "fps_voronoi_r2": numpy.ndarray[float64[n_select]]
        the squared "Voronoi radius" of each FPS point (the largest distance to
        one of the points associated to its Voronoi cell

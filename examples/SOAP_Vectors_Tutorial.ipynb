    "In the search for novel materials through computational discovery, it is often necessary to simulate at the limits of computational space and time complexity. Atomic descriptors can make room for greater algorithmic complexity by eliminating unnecessary information or compressing atomic information efficiently. Furthermore, the descriptors ascribed to an atomic environment may prove greater correlation to the properties exhibited by such a material. For example, a common descriptor XX correlates with property XX more than the raw positional and elemental data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing atomic environment descriptors, the ideal descriptor is that which is most compact while losing the least information. For example, consider a descriptor which simply contains the number of atoms in the molecule. While compact (scalar), the information loss would be too great (there would be no way to distinguish between graphene ($C_{24}$) and glucose ($C_6H_{12}O_6$)). Ideally, a descriptor should contain enough information necessary to both 1) correctly match an environment to any isometric transformation of itself and 2) distinguish it from all other environments. Therefore, it should be translationally, rotationally, and permutatively invariant. "

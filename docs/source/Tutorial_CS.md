# Chemical shifts fitting

Another example uses the <a href="https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-018-06972-x/MediaObjects/41467_2018_6972_MOESM4_ESM.txt"><b>CSD-500 database</b></a>. It calculates chemical shifts of the separate atoms in molecular crystals, using the information about local chemical environments. Actually, it requires almost the same information and functions. The biggest difference comes from calculating the kernel, which appears to be local, not global. Let's see what we can do using Rascal.

Implementation 
=================

Rascal is built as an efficient C++ core, that can be easily accessed 
from Python. Coding philosophy and style conventions are discussed in the
Developer's guide dev_

Here we discuss the general structure of the code, the main objects that
are used, and the rationale for various design choices.

Structures and Clusters
-----------------------

An atomic structure is a collection of atoms, with properties associated 
to it. In the most abstract way possible, properties can be attached to the
entire structure, to atoms, or to groups of atoms (pairs, triplets, ...)
which we refer to as "clusters".
For instance, the energy is a property associated to an entire molecule or
crystal structure, the nuclear chemical shift is a property associated to 
atoms, a distance is a property of a pair of atoms, and so on. 
We refer to the number of atoms involved in a cluster as the order of that 
cluster. An atom is a cluster with `Order=1`, a pair is a cluster with
`Order=2` and so on. 

Structure Managers
------------------


``StructureManager`` is the main class forming the backbone of Rascal. 
It takes care of:

* Holding information about an atomic structure
* Building clusters based on existing structural information
* Filtering, sorting or modifying existing clusters
* Computing properties of clusters (e.g. distances, angles, ...)
* Providing iterators that can be used to loop over clusters of a given type,
  and to access properties associated with clusters of each body order.

In practice the ``StructureManager`` allocates the memory to store
property data, which can be accessed as a heterogeneous map containing
different types of properties. It also provides an interface to access 
clusters in terms of iterators: the internal implementation of the 
neighbor list is left to the implementation, and it only should allow
to retrieve ``ClusterRef`` objects, that act as a light pointer to the 
sequential list of clusters, and contains the indices of the atoms involved
in the cluster. 

``ClusterRef`` objects can be in turn iterated on, giving access to a 
concise notation to iterate over atoms, pairs, triplets, ...

This is best explained with a code snippet

.. code-block:: c++
    
    StructureManager SM(structure_data); // assume this can compute pairs and distances
    SM.update();   // refreshes the list of pairs
    
    energy = SM.get_real(0, "energy") // structure-global property access
    //access to atomic positions, explicit typing
    pos = SM.get_3vec(1, "positions"); 
    // pos = SM.get("positions");  // implicit (slower)
    dist = SM.get_real(2, "distances");
    
    for (auto atom: SM) {
      // iterates over order-1 clusters (atoms)
      ri = pos[atom] //accesses the position of an iterated atom
      
      for (auto pair: atom) {
        // iterates over order-2 clusters (pairs)
        dij = dist[pair]  // accesses the distance between the two atoms
        
        rj = pos[pair]  // the cluster can be used to access properties of 
                        // the last member of the cluster
      }
    }
    

Stacking of StructureManagers
-----------------------------

Structure managers can be build in a modular fashion by stacking them on
top of each other. That is, one can add functionalities to an existing 
manager by creating an adapter, which is just a structure manager that is 
built based on a lower-level manager. 
Each manager after the first (which can e.g. be built based on a input 
structure, or fetching data from a host code such as LAMMPS) takes the 
status of an existing manager and "adapts" it by computing properties, 
creating clusters of higher order, or filtering existing clusters.

Conceptually this can be understood as if the state of a manager was 
described by a series of layers, one for each cluster order, starting
from an empty slate in which no data exists. Each layer
knows how to reference clusters at a given level, and can possibly contain
new properties that are defined for each cluster it can index.

Consider for instance the following stack:

1. A structure is read from file, and contains only the list of atoms. Each
item in the index list corresponds to an atom, and can be used to index 
associated properties, e.g. the position of each atom

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-1.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

2. Pair clusters are computed with a linked-cell algorithm
[AllenTildesley]_. The parameters
of the manager determines how the pairs are constructed, and no distance is 
actually computed and stored

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-2.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

3. Distances are computed for a subset of the pairs, e.g. only for pairs 
within a strict cutoff of 3â„«. Only a subset of the pairs computed at the 
previous layer is indexed. We will discuss later how one can index multiple 
layers without runtime overhead.

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-3.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

4. Only oxygen atoms, and pairs involving oxygen atoms are selected. Note that
this adds a new layer to both atoms and pairs.

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-4.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

5. Triplets of oxygen atoms are constructed, and angles computed between them.
A new layer is created for triplets and properties are simultaneously stored

     :scale: 30
     :align: center
     
It is important to keep in mind that this architecture is not associated with a
separate control structure in the code, but is realized at compile time by 
template algebra based on the ``StructureManager`` class. Structure managers
provide storage space for most of the data (both properties and indices) and
infrastructure to access this data with minimal memory duplication and 
computational overhead.


ClusterRefs, Property and indexing
----------------------------------

The actual infrastructure to index and access cluster data is created at 
compile time and linked statically, so despite the apparent complexity there
is little to no associated overhead. 

.. image:: ../figures/implementation_clusterref.svg

Compile-time lookup of the appropriate property is achieved by means
of the ``ClusterRef`` object, that holds a list of the location in memory of 
each cluster at a given layer in the hierarchy. A ``ClusterRef`` object is 
an iterate, and an index that can be used to access properties. It can also 
be used as a container to return an iterator to clusters of higher order, as
shown in the code snippets above.

Note that, once clusters of a given order have been created, Managers and 
Adaptors can only select or reshuffle them, and not create new ones. 
As a consequence, it is always possible to refer to deeper layers from 
higher ones. A ``StructureManager`` object that introduces a new layer and 
modifies clusters will create a cluster index array that specifies how each
of the clusters that is present at that layer is mapped onto deeper layers.
This means that higher layers can always access properties that have been
computed at a deeper level without the need for recomputing or duplicating 
the data.

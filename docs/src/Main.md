	\section A The main idea
	This is the documentation of Rascal <a href="https://github.com/cosmo-epfl/librascal"><b>(GitHub)</b></a> - free scalable and versatile library to generate representations for atomic-scale learning. Rascal calculations is based on the many papers, describing such things as molecular descriptors and the Gaussian process regression in application to molecular properties calculations. Rascal was developed by the team of 
<a href="https://cosmo.epfl.ch/">Laboratory of Computational Science and Modelling</a> in EPFL. 
	\section B Getting started
	To see how to install Rascal, follow the <a href="md_Installation.html"><b> installation link</b></a>.

	\section C Tutorial
	As a tutorial, you can have a look at two python notebooks to see how you can proceed from the dataset to molecular properties. In case you are interested in that, follow the <a href="usergroup0.html"><b>tutorial link</b></a>.

	\section D Theory
	To learn more about the theory standing behind the Rascal, follow the <a href="SOAP_documentation.pdf"><b>review link</b></a>. It contains the paper describing the math used in calculations with some references. For [kind of] full reference list click on <a href="md_References.html"><b>references link</b></a>.

	\section E Code walkthrough
	To learn more about the code structure, you can take a look at the auto-generated documentation of the code: <br>
